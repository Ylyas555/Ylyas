    <h1>My Journey Through Education and Experience</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
             My educational journey, rooted in diverse experiences and a passion
              for learning, has equipped me with a unique set of skills that I am excited 
              to apply in my future endeavors.
            
            I began my academic journey at Secondary School â„–23 in Amyderya, Koytendag,
             Turkmenistan. This strong foundation provided
              me with a broad curriculum that fostered my love for learning. During these
               formative years, I discovered my aptitude for mathematics, a subject that 
               has always fascinated me. 
            
            In September 2022, I continued my education at Istanbul Medipol University,
             pursuing a degree in English Language Teaching. This experience broadened my 
             horizons, allowing me to explore innovative teaching methodologies and deepen
              my understanding of linguistic nuances. 
            
            Currently, I am enrolled in the Software Developer program at Indian Hills Community
             College. This program has been a thrilling exploration
              of programming languages and software engineering principles. It perfectly combines 
              my mathematical skills with technology, allowing me to solve complex problems and 
              develop innovative solutions.</p>
