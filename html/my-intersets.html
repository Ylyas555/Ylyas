        <h4><ul><li>Comparative Religion</li></ul></h4>
        <p>My fascination with comparative religion stems from a deep curiosity
            about the beliefs and practices that shape cultures around the globe. 
            Studying various religions allows me to explore the fundamental questions 
            of existence, morality, and purpose. I am particularly interested in how
            different faiths address similar themes, such as compassion, justice, and
            the human experience. Although talking about religion and politics can put you in a trouble, 
            I disagree with Gabriel Iglesias in his quote.</p>

    <div class="third"><h4><ul><li>Politics</li></ul></h4>
            <p>Politics is another area that captivates my attention. The dynamics
               of power, governance, and social change are crucial in shaping our 
               societies. I am particularly interested in the intersection of politics 
               and religion, examining how belief systems influence political ideologies
               and policies. This intersection is especially relevant in today's world,
               where discussions about rights, freedoms, and justice are at the forefront
               of public discourse.</p>
            <h4><ul><li>Sports</li></ul></h4>
            <p>
    
                Sports have played a significant role in my life, shaping my values and interests.
                 My favorite sport is soccer, a game that brings together not only athleticism but also teamwork and strategy.
                 I enjoy both playing and watching it, as each match is a blend of skill, passion, and excitement. </p></div>
